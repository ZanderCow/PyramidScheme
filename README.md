# PyramidScheme

## Overview
This repository contains the final project for my Data Structures class, representing a virtual simulation of a pyramid scheme. In this project, I have utilized my knowledge of recursion, binary trees, and JUnit testing to create a comprehensive simulation of how pyramid schemes operate and their impact.

### What is a Pyramid Scheme?
A pyramid scheme is an illegal and fraudulent business model where participants are convinced to pay a fee to the person who recruited them. The central idea is that one can earn more by recruiting others. Each member gives a share of the fees they collect to their recruiter, creating a flow of money that moves upward within the hierarchy. While early participants might see some profit, the scheme inevitably collapses once new recruitments decrease, leaving most participants with losses.

## Project Goals
The primary objective of this project is to:
- Demonstrate and solidify my understanding of recursion and binary trees in a real-world application.
- Use JUnit testing to ensure the reliability and correctness of the simulation.

## Features
- **Simulation of Pyramid Scheme Dynamics:** The project models the hierarchical structure of a pyramid scheme and the flow of money within it.
- **Recursion & Binary Trees:** Utilized to efficiently manage and simulate the complex structure of a pyramid scheme.
- **JUnit Testing:** Comprehensive tests to validate the functionality and accuracy of the simulation.

## How it Works
The simulation represents each participant in the pyramid scheme as a node in a binary tree. Money transactions and recruitments are handled through recursive functions, demonstrating the cascading effect of such schemes.
